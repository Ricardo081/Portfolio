Hello! This program is a school management system that allows users, depending on their role as either a student or teacher, the ability to register for an account and view their respected portals. If the user is a student, then they'd be able to view their grades, depending on if they'd been entered by teacher. If the user is the teacher, they'd be able to see all the students and freely modify the students' grades. The data entered by students and teachers at the registration page is sent to two SQL databases, one which stores all users and another that stores only students and their grades. The program, through a school-given code can determine wether the user should register as a student or a teacher. This classification information is then saved along with the user's registration information in the database. 

*The program can be seen in operation in the docs folder, images are numbered in order representing the way the program runs.
